Most vulnerabilities were found on network-related issues (Access Vector), which suggests that connectivity aspects such as Wi-Fi networks or remote access points are often exploited. Equally noteworthy is the fact that authentication is not commonly required for these vulnerabilities to be exploited, indicating that many systems are compromised through unprotected access points. The strong relationship between confidentiality, integrity, and availability suggests that the affected systems are likely part of distributed architectures. This is indicative of a trend where attackers are not just targeting isolated systems but are leveraging the interconnected nature of modern networks to maximize the reach and impact of their malicious activities. The conventional wisdom does not seem to be true given this small sample data, but that does not mean that cybersecurity is huge part of multiple systems that can suffer from multiple attacks from so many ways that technical and non-technical users should always require comprehensive risk assessment and management.
